so it'd be great if you could help me realistic interactive engine simulator for mobile that can have sellable business models and ads (don't put this into work, just for context)
it'd be great if we can modularized the engine parts to make the engine works chronologically and mechanically accurate so it makes sense to laymen users and enthusiasts
it'd be great if we can have workable and referencable granular data outputs for enthusiasts and professionals to 
mobile friendly ui/ux is a must
compact and professional look & feel ui/ux is a must
We could do it in flutter and ffi/ffigen if needed
if you need engine size/power target maybe one cylinder ~115cc for now for simplicity
